# Narnia gifs

A static, free-hosted website to show the gifs from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbV1-T1yCHUIRFcpu-dui1ENcXlVV94C89hYOTIYd5t-l7inoOG67y372O6ZTqy4yG5pw2dzUPuyJT/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).

I used this as a study case for Next.js with a headless CMS.

After testing the CMS with success, I ended up going back to JSONs stored in the project.


# Scaffold Readme

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
